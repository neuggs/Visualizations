## Frank Neugebauer's Visualizations 

Visualizations are a critical element of data science, without which the complexities are difficult to articulate, especially for those who are less interested in data science. There are many types of visualizations and it's important to understand what they are and how they're used. More subtly, the same visualization can be very different depending on the tool used to render it.

## Requirements
You'll need to have the following tools installed if you want to re-create all the visualizations (or any sub-part for tool-specific visualizations):

1. Python
2. R (RStudio)
3. Tableau
4. Power BI

It's worth noting that part of the project using R and Python _within_ Power BI, which is an interesting mixture of tooling.

### Type of Visualizations

- Bar chart
- Line chart
- Stacked bar chart
- Area chart
- Step chart
- Tree map
- Density chart
- Scatter plot
- Bubble chart
- Word cloud
- Sparkline
- Heatmap
- Contour chart
- Spatial chart
- Boxplot
- Bullet chart
- Histogram

I did not include donut charts because I'm opposed to a pie chart with a circle in the middle. For that matter, I'm opposed to pie charts.

## To Use
It's important to understand that the visualizations and the code are separate, which means you have to download or fork the entire repository for any of this to work. Running the code is tool-specific; for example, you'll need Python for the Python visualizations, along with any packages I import (see the code for specific packages).
